    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Troy Davidson. I am a Software Engineering Major.<br>
        I currently live in Rexburg, ID with my wife and 2 boys.<br>
        I work currently as a Senior Licensed Agent for Progressive.<br>
        I did just apply for a front end developer's position with Progressive and I should find out this week or so if
        I get the job.<br>
        Love sports, outdoors, fishing, video games, and board games.<br>
        Looking forward to this class to help my foundation with web development.<br>
       
    </p>
